Bug Reports
Bug 1:
isValid(..) in Appt.java
Line 118
if(startMinute>0 || startMinute< 59)
The operators were reversed from the correct code. This is it a subtle bug that makes the program not able to check if startMinute is valid.
It should be:
if(startMinute<0 || startMinute > 59)

Bug 2:
getAppRange (...) in TimeTable.java
Line 53
for(int i =0; i<=appt.size(); i++) 
The equal sign after the < operator can cause a segmentation fault if the size of the linked list of appts is larger than appts.size.
Correct code: for(int i =0; i<appt.size(); i++) 

Bug 3:
IsLeapYear(...) in CalendarUtil.java
Return false #Line 58
Return true #Line 61
The return values were swapped. This results in incorrect leap years.
